print("hello world")

# so now lets do some string manipulation following the course as we go
print("haris"+"imran")
#so as java the + is for concatination in our string
#another thing is that if the code is not indented well it will not run
#  print("hello world!")   #this will not run because of the indentation error

print("this is how u print an operator "+" in the output string")

#so now we see how the input works
#input("Hello what is yout name?\n")

#print("hello"+ input("what is your name?"))

#print(len(input("enter your name")))
#so this code will take input calculate its lenght and then print this the lenght using the print function but it will also count the spaces in your input
#so if your input is m haris imran then the output will be 13 because of the added amount of spaces


name = input("enter your name") #so these are python variables
print(name)

a = input("enter 1st number")
b = input("enter 2nd number")
print("so now lets switch")

c = b
b = a
a = c

print("a=" + a +"\n b=" + b)
