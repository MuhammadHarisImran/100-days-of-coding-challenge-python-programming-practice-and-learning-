# today we will start with the day 4 of the python course
# so far we learned about the logical and conditional statements as well as taking input and much more
# so now we work wtih moddules, lets see the random function first

import random

random_number = random.randint(100,150)

print (random_number)

# so far this is just with the random function but lets start with the module 

#lets create a module first and add some value in it
